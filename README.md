# Installing

To locally install the bot yourself (e.g. if you want to contribute or self-host), follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.11.0 or later
- Yarn berry (v4)
- A Discord application and bot
- A PostgreSQL database (to run one locally, see [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-install.html))

## Setup

Once you've cloned the repository from GitHub, install the required Node dependencies.

```sh
yarn
```

Copy the `.env.example` file to a new `.env` file and the `config.example.json` file to a new `config.json` file. Then,
fill out the environment variables and configuration values listed inside.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
cp config.example.json config.json
```

Push the Prisma schema to your Postgres database.

```sh
yarn push

# If you don't have a database yet, you can still generate typings
yarn generate
```

Compile the bot with tsc. Leave this terminal tab open while developing the bot. In production, you can use `yarn build`
instead.

```sh
# Development (watch mode)
yarn build:dev

# Production
yarn build
```

Finally, you can run the bot using nodemon in development or pm2 in production.

```sh
# Development
yarn dev # nodemon
# or
yarn start # node

# Production
pm2 start dist/src/index.js
```
